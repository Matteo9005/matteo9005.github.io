GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2024  Matteo9005
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                        Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free software license that guarantees end users
the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. This general public
license applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
programs whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation
software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and
share your changes with others, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you
these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate
to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright
on the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
use the program under certain conditions.

Each licensee is addressed as "you". The activities of the licensee and the author
are defined in the license document. 

Therefore, you should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using
the software.

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each
licensee is addressed as "you". 

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks.

"The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

"A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion
of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

The "Activities" of the licensee and of the author are defined in the license document.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; and that you post a copy of this
License along with the Program.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
changed the files and the date of any change.

  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as
a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice
and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty)
and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the
user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to make it, but must show the appropriate copyright
notice and this License.)

3. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.

4. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on
the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works
based on it.

5. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
License.

6. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or
for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
distribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be
to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

7. Each licensee is addressed as "you". 

8. The term of this License is perpetual.

9. The Program is distributed without any warranty of any kind. The authors shall not
be liable for damages resulting from the use of this software. However, this disclaimer
does not affect any warranties that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

10. If you have received this License with the Program, you should have received a
copy of the GNU General Public License along with the Program. If not, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
